## Authentication

Dynamic Messaging uses Bearer Tokens for Authentication. These are referred to as API keys in the Voice Platform website, and you can find them in the API Keys section of the Client website.

You can create a new API Key if you have none already, and copy the Token to use below.

You can also pass this using a header or on the querystring directly. In this case the header or querystring parameter name should be "api-key".

### Postman

We recommend using Postman for testing the api and for getting a feel for the results etc. Just import our collection into you postman application.
